# Task duplication

Task duplication is a project workflow setting that allows you to create N tasks from a single image so that N different labelers can annotate the image N times.&#x20;

## Create a Project with Task Duplication

While creating a project, in the **Multiple Labeling** section, select **Multiple Outputs** and then select the number of "sibling tasks", i.e., the number of times a task will be duplicated.&#x20;

Once you upload tasks to your project, you will notice _N x the number of images_ uploaded to the project. Each distinct sibling task can be assigned to a different annotator. You can view all sibling tasks together using the "view sibling" task shortcut.&#x20;
