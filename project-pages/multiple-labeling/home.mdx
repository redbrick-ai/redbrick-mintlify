RedBrick AI has comprehensive features to help you record multiple annotations per image or conduct multi-reader studies.&#x20;

There are two core use cases for multiple labeling on RedBrick AI:

1. [**Consensus, or multi-reader, single output:**](./consensus/) Have multiple labelers annotate a single task and record their _inter-annotator agreement scores,_ i.e., measure the overlap between their annotations. The output of consensus is a single set of ground truth.&#x20;
2. [**Task duplication, or multi-reader, multiple output:**](./task-duplication) Have multiple annotators annotate a single image and generate N unique ground truth records for a single image.&#x20;
