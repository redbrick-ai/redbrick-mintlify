## Installation

The RedBrick AI SDK and CLI are available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/redbrick-sdk/) and can be installed using `pip`. The SDK and CLI are packaged together.&#x20;

```bash
$ pip install -U redbrick-sdk
```

<Note>
The SDK and CLI work on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
</Note>

<Warning>
They are compatible with **python version 3.8+**
</Warning>

## API Keys

In order to use the Python SDK or CLI, you'll first need to generate an API key. To do so:

1. Click on **Integrations** (or use the "i" shortcut)
2. Click on **API Keys** (or use the "2" shortcut)
3. In the top right corner, click on **Create API Key**
4. In the pop-up field, give your API key a name

After you've generated your API key, you can copy it to wherever is necessary - your CLI credentials file, your Python file, etc.

**Please note** that all API keys provide the user with the equivalent of [Org Admin permissions](/organizations/what-is-an-organization#organization-level-roles). Be sure to use your API keys with care!

## Organization and Project IDs

For most SDK / CLI operations, you will need your Organization and/or Project ids. These are unique ids for each entity. You can find both the Organization and Project ID inside the **Settings Page of any Project**.&#x20;

You can also find the Organization and Project IDs within the browser URL -> head over to any project - https://app.redbrickai.com/$org_id/projects/$project_id.
