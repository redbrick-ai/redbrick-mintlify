title: Importing Annotations Guide
---

You can import all annotation types that are supported in RedBrick AI, including segmentations, classifications, bounding boxes, and more. Imported annotations will appear automatically on your annotator's interface.

<Warning>
Annotations and images must be imported together at the start.&#x20;
</Warning>

<Warning>
If you want to add annotations programmatically to images that have already been uploaded, [please use the programmatic label & review](sdk-overview/programmatic-label-and-review).
</Warning>

<Warning>
Annotation import is only supported through the SDK and CLI.&#x20;
</Warning>

<Warning>
That is, you cannot use the [direct upload UI](../importing-data/uploading-data-to-redbrick) to import annotations, and you must use the items list with the SDK/CLI to provide the required metadata along with annotations.
</Warning>

To import images along with segmentations, you must provide us with:

1. Images in any supported format and NIftI segmentation files.
2. [An items list](importing-annotations-guide#items-list-for-importing-segmentations) that provides a mapping of:
   * Segmentation files to volumes so that segmentations are applied to correct images.
   * Values within segmentation file to taxonomy categories.

<Check>
Once you've prepared the [items list in the format defined below](importing-annotations-guide#items-list-for-importing-segmentations), you can import the images and annotations using the [`create_datapoints` SDK method](sdk-overview/importing-data-and-annotations) or [CLI `upload` method](cli-overview/import-data-and-annotations).
</Check>

## Items list for importing segmentations

You can find the [full format reference here](formats/full-format-reference#items-list-and-tasks.json). In this section, we will focus on importing segmentations. In the examples below, pay attention to the following fields:&#x20;

1. `segmentations`: The segmentation files to be applied to the task.
2. `segmentMap`: Map the values present in the segmentation files to their corresponding taxonomy categories.

### I: One segmentation file per task

<pre class="language-json" data-line-numbers>
    <code class="lang-json">
        \{
            "name": "...",
            "series": [
                \{
                    "items": ["instance-01.dcm", "instance-02.dcm", ...],
                    
                    "segmentations": "segmentation.nii.gz",
                    
                    "segmentMap": \{
                        "1": "category-a", 
                        "2": "category-b"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    </code>
</pre>

### II: Multiple segmentation files per task

Sometimes, segmentations for a single volume are stored in multiple segmentation files, but these segmentation files are not binary masks. In this case, follow the format below.

<pre class="language-json5"><code class="lang-json5">
    \{
    "name": "...", 
    "series": [
        \{
            "items": ["instance-01.dcm", "instance-02.dcm", ...],
            
            "segmentations": ["segmentation-1.nii.gz", "segmentation-2.nii.gz"],
            
            "segmentMap": \{
                "1": "category-a", 
                "2": "category-b"
            }
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>

### Common mistakes for I and II.&#x20;

<Warning>
* The values 1 and 2 must be present in either `segmentation-1.nii.gz` or `segmentation-2.nii.gz.`
</Warning>
<Warning>
* All values in `segmentation.nii.gz` that are not in `segmentMap` will not be mapped to any taxonomy category in the editor.
</Warning>

### III: Multiple binary segmentation files per task

A common pattern is to store each segmentation instance in a separate NIfTI file as a binary mask. In the example below, all non-zero values in `segmentation-1.nii.gz` are meant to correspond to the taxonomy category `category-a`.&#x20;

<pre class="language-json"><code class="lang-json">
    \{
    "name": "...", 
    "series": [
        \{
            "items": ["instance-01.dcm", "instance-02.dcm", ...],
            
            "segmentations": ["path/segmentation-1.nii.gz", "path/segmentation-2.nii.gz"]
            
            "segmentMap": \{
            
                <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-5">// Read more about "1"</a>
                "1": \{
                
                    <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-6">// Read more about "category"</a>
                    "category": "category-a", 
                    
                    <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-7">// Read more about "mask"</a>
                    "mask": "path/segmentation-1.nii.gz",                 
                }, 
                "2": \{
                    "category": "category-b", 
                    "mask": "path/segmentation-2.nii.gz"
                }, 
                
            }
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>

[^1]: All "1" within segmentation.nii will map to "category-a".

[^2]: The masks here are not necessarily binary masks, i.e., they might have multiple values within them. \
    \
    The mapping between value and category should be stable across files.&#x20;

[^3]: All "1" within both segmentation files will map to "category-a".

[^4]: For this example, each segmentation file is a binary mask, i.e., all non-zero values in a file will be mapped to a single category.

[^5]: When exported, this segmentation will be represented by "1" in the exported NIfTI.

[^6]: This segmentation will be mapped to "category". The "category" must exist in your Project's Taxonomy.

[^7]: This mapping will apply to the segmentation file defined by "mask".

[^8]: This defines that all segmentation files are binary masks, i.e., all non-zero values represent a single category.&#x20;
