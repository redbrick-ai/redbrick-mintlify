title: Exporting Annotations
---

You can make use of RedBrick AI's Python SDK to export your annotations using a Python script.&#x20;

Within the Python SDK, annotations are exported in two ways:&#x20;

1. The `export_tasks` function **returns a Python object** containing meta-data information and any vector annotations (measurements, landmarks, etc.). Please see the [format of the object here](https://docs.redbrickai.com/python-sdk/reference/export-annotation-format).&#x20;
2. By default, segmentation data is written to your disk **in NIfTI format**. Segmentation data can also be exported in PNG or RT Struct by manipulating the parameters of the `export_tasks` function. Please view the detailed [`export_tasks` reference here](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#redbrick.export.Export.export_tasks).&#x20;

<Note>
If you're attempting a one-time export or don't have intensive requirements for your export, the [**CLI** ](https://docs.redbrickai.com/python-sdk/cli-overview/exporting-annotations)also provides a simple and optimized workflow for exporting a Project's annotations.&#x20;
</Note>

## Export Folder Structure

RedBrick AI exports annotations in a JSON structure, accompanied by [NIfTI-1 masks](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/) for segmentations. All data will be exported within a folder named after your `project_id`, with the following structure:

```
project_id/
├── segmentations
│   ├── study01
│   │   └── series1.nii
│   └── study02
│       ├── series1.nii
│       └── series2.nii
└── tasks.json
```

<Check>
The above structure is for a standard export (i.e. not semantic, not binary mask, etc.) and assumes no [overlapping segmentations](/annotation-and-viewer/segmentation/overlapping-segmentations#exporting-overlapping-segmentations).&#x20;
</Check>

### Segmentations Subdirectory

The segmentation directory will contain a single sub-directory for each task in your export. The sub-directories will be named after the task [`name`](./exporting-annotations#name-string). A single task (depending on whether it was single series or multi-series) can have one or more segmentations.

The individual segmentation files will be in NIfTI-1 format and be [named after the user-defined series name](./exporting-annotations#name-string-1). If no series name is provided on upload, RedBrick will assign a unique name. Corresponding meta-data ex. category names will be provided in [tasks.json](./exporting-annotations#tasks-json).

## Code Examples

As always, you should first perform the [standard RedBrick AI SDK setup](./#initializing-the-redbrick-sdk-in-python) to create a Project object.

```python
project = redbrick.get_project(org_id, project_id, api_key)
```

With a new Project object created, you can export your Project's Tasks in various ways. Please see some common examples below.

#### Export All Tasks

The `export_tasks()` function exports segmentation files for all Ground Truth Tasks by default. To export All Tasks, set the `only_ground_truth` parameter to `False`.

```python
annotations = project.export.export_tasks(only_ground_truth=False)
```

#### Export Only Ground Truth

You can export only the Tasks in Ground Truth, i.e., Tasks that have successfully made it through all Label and Review Stages.&#x20;

```python
gt_annotations = project.export.export_tasks(only_ground_truth=True)
```

#### **Export Specific Tasks**

Export selected Tasks by specifying Task IDs.&#x20;

```python
specific_annotations = project.export.export_tasks(task_id="...")
```

## Generate an Audit Trail

An audit trail can be useful for regulators interested in your quality control processes, as well as for managing your internal QA processes.&#x20;

<Check>
Please see a detailed reference for[`get_task_events` here](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#redbrick.export.Export.get_task_events).
</Check>

First, perform the [standard RedBrick AI SDK setup](./#initializing-the-redbrick-sdk-in-python) to create a Project object.&#x20;

#### Audit Trail - All Tasks

If you'd like to generate an audit trail for **all Tasks** (not only those in the Ground Truth Stage), be sure to include the `only_ground_truth=False` parameter.

```python
---
title: Return an audit trail for all Tasks in all Stages
---
audit_trail = project.export.get_task_events(only_ground_truth=False)
```

#### Audit Trail - Ground Truth Tasks Only

Retrieve an audit trail for all Ground Truth Task&#x73;**.** Please note that by default, `get_task_events` only returns audit information for Tasks in the Ground Truth Stage.&#x20;

```python
project = redbrick.get_project(org_id, project_id, api_key)

---
title: Return an audit trail for all Tasks currently in the Ground Truth Stage
---
audit_trail = project.export.get_task_events()
```

The returned object will contain data similar to the code snippet below, where each entry will represent a single Task (uniquely identified by `taskId`). The `events` array contains all key events/actions performed on the Task, with `events[0]` being the first event.

```json
[
  {
    "taskId": "...",
    "currentStageName": "Label",
    "events": [
      {
        "eventType": "TASK_CREATED",
        "createdAt": "...",
        "isGroundTruth": false,
        "createdBy": "..."
      },
      {
        "eventType": "TASK_ASSIGNED",
        "createdAt": "...",
        "assignee": "...",
        "stage": "Label"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Additional Capabilities

The following is a non-exhaustive list of other available functionalities when using the [`Export` class](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#export). A full list of the capabilities of our `Export` class can be found [here](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#redbrick.export.Export).

* Track labeler or reviewer time spent on a Task with [`get_active_time()`](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#redbrick.export.Export.get_active_time);
* Fetch Task events from a specific timestamp to the present day using [`get_task_events()`](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#redbrick.export.Export.get_task_events) and the `from_timestamp` parameter;
* Easily search for Tasks based on a wide variety of criteria using [`list_tasks()`](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#redbrick.export.Export.list_tasks);
* Perform a semantic export (that exports a single file per category name) using [`export_tasks()`](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#redbrick.export.Export.export_tasks);
* Configure [Hanging Protocol](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#redbrick.settings.Settings.hanging_protocol)s;
* Upload a [script](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#redbrick.settings.Settings.label_validation) for [Custom Label Validation](../../project-pages/settings-page/custom-label-validation);
