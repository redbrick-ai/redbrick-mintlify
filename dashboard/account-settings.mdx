## Multi-factor Authentication

As of `v1.2.0`, all RedBrick users must have MFA enabled in order to work on the platform.&#x20;

RedBrick AI offers both Email MFA and Authenticator App MFA.

Any users who have a unique [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/organizations/inviting-your-team/single-sign-on) protocol enabled for their RedBrick environment are  considered to have MFA enabled.
