title: Preview Tool
---

RedBrick AI's Preview Tool allows users to see how their images, volumes, and annotations are displayed within RedBrick AI's Annotation Tool without having to [create a Project](/quick-start/get-started-with-a-project#creating-a-project) or integrate a third-party [Storage Method](/importing-data/import-cloud-data).

As of `v1.2.3`., users can preview images and/or annotations from either their local machine or any Storage Method they have integrated into their RedBrick Organization.

***

### **Previewing a Local File**

1. Open the Preview Tool, located in the lefthand sidebar of the Home Page;
2. Select a file source: **Load from file system;**
3. Within **Preview Tool**, select the image(s) you would like to display or simply drag and drop them into the corresponding left hand window;
4. (Optional) select the annotation file you would like to display or simply drag and drop it into the corresponding right hand window;
5. Click on **View Data;**
6. Use the **Manage Files** button (top right hand corner) and **Replace** buttons (in the dialog menu) to swap out new files as needed;

3. In the **List of items** field, provide the partial or full paths for the images you wish to preview, separated by a comma or newline;

<Note>
If you are uploading a segmentation file, Preview Tool will automatically map the annotations and display them as unique Instances in the left hand toolbar.

Please note that images and volumes can be manipulated in Preview Tool just as they would be in the standard Annotation Tool. The following functions represent a non-exhaustive list of features available in Preview Tool:

* Windowing Settings
* Thresholding Settings
* MPR Layout
* Command Bar (and commands such as "toggle Linear Pixel Interpolation", "toggle permanent crosshairs", etc.)
* Oblique Planes
* Horizontal and Vertical Flipping
* Viewport Maximization and Minimization;
* ...and more!
