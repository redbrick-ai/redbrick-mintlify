***********************

RedBrick AI is a SaaS platform for annotating medical images. RedBrick
AI provides web based annotation tools, quality control capabilities,
collaboration tools, and SDK/CLI to integrate with MLOps.

  Please visit our website to learn more about RedBrick AI, or request
  for a free-trial. You can visit the platform documentation here
  https://docs.redbrickai.com/.

The RedBrick AI SDK and CLI are useful for managing data IO
operations, and programmatically interacting with the application. The
CLI is best for simple operations like import and export; whereas, the
SDK is best for complex operations like importing annotations,
searching through data, etc.

**Installation**

The SDK and CLI are available on PyPI and can be installed using
*pip*.

   $ pip install redbrick-sdk

**Authentication**

To use the SDK and CLI, you need a API key. You can fetch the API key
from the RedBrick AI dashboard, found on the right sidebar "API keys".
