title: Project & Task Analytics
---

As of `version 1.1.0`, the RedBrick UI offers a variety of metrics in order to make tracking your (or your team's) progress easier than ever before.&#x20;

## Project Analytics

On your Project's Data Page, admins can easily access a variety of productivity-related information about the Project Workforce by using the lefthand toolbar and applying the desired filters.

To generate Task-based metrics for a specific user, first select the user in the top-left dropdown field  and apply a date range.

The Project Analytics tab contains the following fields:

* **Finalizations** - the number of times the User finalized a Task in the Pre-Label or Label Stage;
* **Completed** - the number of times a Task the User worked on reached the Ground Truth Stage;
* **Acceptances received** - the number of times a Task the User worked on was accepted in a Review Stage;
* **Rejections received** - the number of times a Task the User worked on was rejected in a Review Stage;
* **Corrections received** - the number of times a Task the User worked on was accepted with corrections;
* **Avg. labeling time** - the average amount of time the user spends on labeling a Task before pushing it to a later Stage;
* **Total labeling time** - the total amount of time the user has spent on labeling Tasks;

## Task Analytics

RedBrick also allows users to see information related to the contents of Tasks that they have access to.

On the Data Page, a user can click on the Task Analytics button for a given Task to see information about:

* the Object Labels (i.e. annotations) present in the Task
* Task History
* Labeling History
* Reviewing History
