# Multiple Modalities

You can now combine multiple modalities such as 2D image, videos, and 3D scans and annotate them all together as a single study.

To create a study using multiple modalities, just upload the data together as a single task. You can upload as many DICOM or NIfTI series as you want. You can also include standard web image formats such as .jpg and .png however these will be treated as a single entity, either a single video clip or a single image, depending on the number of files.

Depending on which viewport you have selected and the type of data in that viewport, different label types will be available to create.&#x20;
