# Inviting Your Team

**HEY, LISTEN! -** The following instructions do not apply to Organizations who have implemented [SSO](/organizations/inviting-your-team/single-sign-on).

## Viewing Your Team

You can view all the current members of your Organization inside the **Team Tab** on the left sidebar.&#x20;

Once on the Team Page, you'll also be able to see:

* Your colleagues' email addresses;
* Your colleagues' Organization-level roles;
* The tags that you have optionally created to organize the users in your Organization;

To invite a team member to your Organization, click on **Invite Member**, enter their email address and select their [Organization-level role](/organizations/what-is-an-organization#organization-level-roles) (i.e. either Org Admin or Org Member).&#x20;
