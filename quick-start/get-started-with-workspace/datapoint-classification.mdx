To manually classify data, you can use the Datapoint classification schema in the workspace settings. The classifications can be various types, such as True or False, Selection, Multi-Selection, or Textfield. Once modified, these classifications can be used for searching and filtering. Classification can be done either from the table or while previewing images.
